Orientation Using Servo Motors:
- Get values of rotation directly from what you tell it (I think)
- Calibrate by setting ZERO_ELEVATION_DUTY and ZERO_AZIMUTH_DUTY

Questions
	- how does Stewart move the motor in his serial example
	- What is the limitation of the motors rotation 



Orientation Using Gyro
- Obtain raw data
- Use proper constant to integrate information to obtain orientation
- Remove bias in the gyro
- scale values???
- calibration (set zero points??)

######### NOTE: can check orientation via earths magnetic field (using magnetic values) 
#########	or atleast angle of change



######################## BIAS ##########################
- Gyroscope measure rotation about a point 
- Acceleromerter measures displacement'

Bias:  initial zero reading of the gyroscope will cause drift over time due 
	to integration of inherent imperfections and noise within the device. 
	Bias repeatability can be calibrated across the known temperature range of the IMU

Drift error: gyroscope drift is mainly due to the integration of two components: 
	a slow changing, near-dc variable called bias instability and 
	a higher frequency noise variable called angular random walk (ARW)


- Drift error can be partially filtered out using a low pass or kalman filter

- Also drift error can be mitigated by use of the magnetic field
- Can also null gyroscope offset to zero when you know the gyroscope is stationary
- The constant bias error of a gyroscope can be measured by taking the average of the output over a long period of time while the device is not rotating
