############################### Major project development stages and the modules to add at each stage ###################################

Major project development stages:
	• Detect object presence in front of a stationary lidar 
		○ Module to get lidar readings 
		○ Module to analyse data and decide if object is present (detection module)
	• Detect objects in front of a rotating lidar 
		○ Module to move lidar 
		○ Update detection module to account for lidar orientation 
	• Increase lidar accuracy by taking multiple measurements in each position and averaging 
	• Make measurements of orientation more accurate using gyroscope data 
		○ Module to get gyroscope readings
		○ Module to integrate gyroscope readings, remove bias and calculate more accurate positioning 
	• Display the number of a free booth on the LCD screen
		○ Module to interface with LCD screen
		○ Update detection module to decide which booth is empty (number booths and add struct to indicate which are empty)
	• Play tune when a booth is free 
		○ Module to play music tune
		○ Update detection module to play tune when booth is free
	• Display on PC the current status of every booth and update when a booth empties/gets filled 
		○ Serial module to interface with PC
    		○ Python module to display booth status
